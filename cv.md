I am a Front-end developer. The main reason I am passionate about developing is that I can leverage my creativity, because there are so many ways to achieve the same goal when you code a software and I like to find the optimal one for each scenario.
My strengths are excellent written and verbal communication skills. I can usually win people over to my point of view. Also, I’m competitive and like to excel at everything I do. My goal is to achieve results beyond the expectations of my supervisor. And last but not least, I’m very flexible and adaptable to new situations. Regardless of the situation, I have the ability to adapt and work under any circumstances. These skills seem to be directly related to the job.
